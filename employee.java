I am an nous info employee

sangrutransient user has changed the file employee.java

Now sangram1423 is trying to change the the same file employee.java and pushing to remote repository.

<<<<<<< HEAD (sangram1423)
sangrutransient has modified the same file employee.java which 
sangram1423 is also changing at the same time with the sangru1423 user.
======= (sangrutransient)
Now sangrutransient user is changeing the employee.java file and commiting and pushing.
>>>>>>> 7e3ac17a2d8ae2753bcd459436f7323701752037

So the "git pull" will conflict the file which has been modified by multiple users same time.
In that case we need to schedule a meeting with the user and manually arrange the code and commit it with new intregrated code and push the change to remote repository.
