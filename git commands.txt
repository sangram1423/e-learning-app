1. git init - to create git configuration in our project, which will generate a ".git" file (hidden)
2. git config -> will setup username, email and password for the git configuration global and locally, so that it will not ask for pushing the latest code multiple times. commands are below
3. git config --global user.name "sangram1423"
4. git config --glibal user.email "technomsangru@gmail.com"
5. git status -> will show all unstaged files from where you have made the "git init" or where you have ".git" hidden file.
6. git add file_name -> will add a single file (file_name) into the staging area for commit.
7. git add . -> . will add all the files/folders which are there in the folder where you made "git init".
8. git commit -m "first commit" -> will commit all the files/folders to our repository but will not show all files/folders in our repository.
	-m = message for commit 
9. git branch -M main -> it will change the 'master' branch name to 'main' branch.
	-M = will change the branch name
10. git remote add origin "repository url" -> it will add your codes into the remote repository where you wanted to store all your codes.
11. git push -u origin master/main -> I have have changed the branch from master to main using "git branch -M main" So I need to use the command for pushing as "git push -u origin main".
12. git log -> for seeing all our commits into the remote repository.
13. git log 10 -> will show only latest 10 commits from the remote repository

Q-1-) Suppose I have modified few files and I wanted to push to the remote repository with my personal commits. what should I use commands to push.

git status -> will show all modified files and all unstaged file.
So I want to add the modified file not unstaged files then use below commands
git add file_name
git commit -m "added new file"
git push  -> will push to origin main/master (it will push only the modified file not the unstaged files)

Q-2) I have 2 staged file but I don't want to make push those 2 files, So I need to do unstage (red color). what command I should execute?

git status -> will show staged files (green color)
git restore --staged .  -> all files will be moved from staged to unstaged (Note -: if they are not commited and pushed)

git restore --staged file_name -> will do unstage single mentioned file.

Q-3) How "restore" command works as multi purpose? (for unstage / discard changes)
Ans- : If you do some modification to a file and in your remote repository you have old content file. but you modified in your system. you want to remove those newly modified codes then you should go for 2 commands to fix
	1.1 either you can use "git add file_name" to add those file and commit and push 
	1.2 or you can use "git restore file_name" to remove our new changes to the file. it will update with the updated remote repository content.

14. git pull - to get latest code from the master
15. git clone repository_url -> will download from the github repository to our local computer and start working on the requirement and add -> commit -> push 
Note-: Some other developer modified some files in github and commited and pushed then we should use the "git pull" to get the latest code.
16.git help -> will show all commands of git hub.
17. git help command_name -> will show mentioned command_name functionality to use.
	e.g-> git help init
